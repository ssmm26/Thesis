Our web platform receives millions of hits a day from a customer base that spans the globe from Japan to South Africa.

You will be involved with our UX team from ideation to prototyping to production, and have an active voice in UI development. You will work with architects to map out core framework components and provide guidance to junior developers. You will work with other developers in a Scrum team to deliver features for the Kobo store. Somewhere in between, you get to go to conferences and organize internal tech events of your own. Although we have grown quite far from being a start-up, we like to keep the best parts of it around here. Our workplace is open and even the most senior architect is just a few desks away. We still have scrums and small team sizes. We have happy hours every month to keep everyone, well, happy.
